  <p id ="introduction">You have been summoned by "Conservation International" to save the Indo-Burma 
    forests located in the Indo-Chinese subregion. The forests cover Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, 
    and parts of southern China. They are considered one of the richest biodiversed locations in the world because of its diverse
    ecosystem composition, including mixed wet and dry evergreen forests, deciduous and montane forests, lowland floodplains, swamps, and mangroves.
    The greatest threat to its biodiversity is habitat loss, primarily caused through deforestation due to commercial 
    logging and agriculture. <b>Your mission is to stop the loggers...</b></p>
